# On Automatic Text Extractive Summarization Based on Attention Mechanism and Graph Convolutional Netwrok

This code is the implemetation of my Master's theis, part of my work can be seen in https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04878

This work aims to improve the extractive summarization model by combining the attention and graph neural network.

## Usage
1. Download and preprocess the data by the method in the [data preproess](https://) folder.
2. Excute the method for the processing data
